## BroadcastChannel API: Sending Messages Between Tabs

Communicating between different tabs or windows in a web browser is super important for many reasons. Imagine you have several open tabs while shopping online. You put an item in your cart in one tab, and you want all the other tabs to know about it instantly. That's one of the reasons we need this kind of communication. Also, think about logging into a website like your bank account. If we log out in one tab, we'd want to be logged out in all the other tabs, too to keep everything safe. It's like making sure you lock all the doors when leaving your house. So, it's not just convenient; it also makes the web safer and more efficient for us.
